# My Statement of Purpose for (Un)structured
I have learnt python, plus we have also been taught python for AE102. I
have learnt C and C++ also. I do know the basics of java too, since I had it
for my 10 std ICSE boards. I don’t have any experience when it comes to
Machine Learning, however I am eager to learn it and willing to devote as
much time as possible.

This project has immense uses in our day to day life. Google lens and
bixby visions work on the same principle. For example, when you are in
foreign countries it is very difficult to undestand menus and other
information which are usually not written in English. In such cases, we can
easily take a photo and have a program read the text and convert it to a
language we undestand. This tool can be implemented by self driving cars
too where they can take images of speedlimits etc and read it and then
adopt it.We can use it to increase security. After scanning ID card, it
matches all the information on it.Hence this project has immense uses in
our lives and hence I am eager to be a part of it.


# Edited Timeline:

Week 1:
1. Learn the basics of version control (GitHub). Brush up your Python
programming skills.
2. Install Ubuntu(I already have ubuntu on my laptop) and setup a
development environment.
3. Learn about Linux commands, working with numpy, Jupyter.

Week 2:
1. Start learning about Neural Networks.

Week 3:
1. Continue learning about Deep Learning architectures

Following weeks : I would like to follow the Tentative Project
Timeline.

# My undestanding of the problem statement:
First we may have to differentiate the different “types” of text.
We will have to consider the following parameters like:

1. Text Font and Size or whether its in italics or in bold or its undelined etc

2. Density of the text i.e how many words are actually there per area of the
image.

3. Nature of the text: How are the words placed? Is it strictly in rows or is
it scribbled across the image.

Obviously, we should not start with any image. First we may start with
images having so called “default types of text”, like screenshots of well
laid out text, perhaps of a website .
We could also apply thresholding and other techniques provided we know
HSV data of the image.
By the above filters we will be able to atleast locate where the text is.

I am very eager to learn new things and I am very interested in
learning machine learning and am willing to devote time for it.

May the force be with you.
